PROCESSING IMAGE AFTER IT HAS BEEN TAKEN
-----------------------------------------

- After the image has been taken using the esp32 camera it has to be processed. 
- The image will be prepared using OpenCV before sending it to the Machine Learning Model for more processing. 
- The goal for today is to add OpenCV so that it can crop the image and prepare it for processing. 

- Change of plans I will use the server to process the image. 
- On the Django server that is where I will set up OpenCV. 
- I will also add the AI there. 
- This is so that the app is small and not expensive to run on some phones. This is so that anyone with a moderate phone can still download the app.

- With the app I want to do the following :
	- Submit the form that will be used when getting the results.
	- The image is part of the form. 
	- Display the statistics for the cholera cases in Zambia. 
		- For each month the number of positive cases , the deaths and the cures .
	- Send alerts to the users of new cases in specific areas. 
	- Daily update that will be displayed on the frontend. 
	- A blog. 
		- One picture.	
		- A file to download 
		- A brief description

- The models have been created. 
- Next step is to serialize the data. 

- The backend has been created. 
- The data has been serialized. 
- Next step is to add OpenCV
