Things that I need to do for the backend. 
-----------------------------------------

- Create the models (DONE)
- Serialize the models (DONE)
- Add authentication (DONE)
- Add OpenCV to process the image after the Report Form has been submitted. (DONE)
- After it has been processed an AI model has to analyze the image and determine the result.
	- Instead of using the AI model to analyze the results I will use OpenCV. (DONE) 
- The results will be stored in the Results model which will then be displayed to the user. 
- Create a dashboard for the super admin , the admin and the general workers using different groups. 
- Each group will have its own permissions. 
- Use a different database . Use MySQL.
